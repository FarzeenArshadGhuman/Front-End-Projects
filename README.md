This repository showcases a collection of both front-end and back-end web projects I've developed using a variety of technologies, including:

### Front-End:
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** / **Bootstrap**
- **JavaScript** / **jQuery**
- **React.js**

### Back-End:
- **PHP** / **MySQL** / **SQL**
- **Node.js** / **Express.js**

These projects demonstrate the development of both the user interface and server-side functionality, from simple landing pages to fully functional web applications with dynamic data handling.

## Projects Included:
- **Portfolio Website**: A personalized, responsive portfolio showcasing my skills and projects.


## Goals:
- Enhance **UI/UX** design skills with a focus on user interaction and design principles.
- Build **full-stack applications** using both front-end and back-end technologies to create dynamic, data-driven websites.
- Improve **server-side skills** like working with APIs, database management, and authentication.
- Showcase proficiency in both **front-end** and **back-end** development.
